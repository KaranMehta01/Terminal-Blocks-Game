# Terminal-Blocks-Game

How to play / Rules:

1. It is a very simple game in which you have to place some shapes on a grid.
2. You get points on placing a shape based on how many cells of the board it covers.
3. When a row/column is filled with blocks, all the blocks in that row/column are removed and you get points in place of that.
4. If you fill more than one row/column after placing a block, then you get bonus points based on how many rows/columns you have filled.
5. Whenever you fill row/rows/column/columns, your combo increments by 1 (The combo is initialized as 0 at the starting of the game).
6. Score you gained by filling rows/columns is first multiplied by combo and then added to total score.
7. When you don't fill a row/column, your combo resets to 0.
